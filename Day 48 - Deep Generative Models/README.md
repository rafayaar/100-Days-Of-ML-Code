## Day 47 - Time Series Analysis

- This code implements a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to perform dimensionality reduction and generate images, using TensorFlow and the MNIST dataset.

- The VAE architecture includes an encoder to map data to a latent space, a decoder to reconstruct data from the latent space, and a custom loss function that combines reconstruction and KL divergence terms.

- It demonstrates a simple way to train and generate samples from the VAE model for tasks such as image generation or data compression.
