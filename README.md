# 100 Days of Machine Learning Code
This repository is dedicated to my 100-day journey of coding in machine learning. The goal of this challenge is to strengthen my understanding of machine learning concepts, algorithms, and applications through consistent coding practice. Each day, I will focus on a specific topic or project related to machine learning and write code to implement and explore it.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this 100-day challenge is to deepen my knowledge and skills in machine learning. By dedicating focused time and effort each day, I aim to:

- Enhance my understanding of fundamental machine learning algorithms and techniques.
- Gain hands-on experience by implementing various machine learning models and projects.
- Explore advanced topics in machine learning such as deep learning, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing.
- Develop proficiency in popular machine learning frameworks and libraries, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.
- Sharpen my problem-solving and coding abilities through consistent practice.
## Repository Structure
- Each day's code and related files will be organized in a separate folder, labeled with the corresponding day number.
- The code files will be written in Python and will include detailed comments for clarity and explanation.
- Any additional resources, such as datasets or pre-trained models, will be provided within each day's folder.
- The README.md file within each folder will contain a brief description of the topic or project for that day.
## Progress Tracking
I will TRY MY BEST 😅 to maintain a log of my daily progress in a separate document or in the main README.md file. This log will include a summary of the topic or project covered each day, challenges faced, lessons learned, and any notable achievements or insights gained. Additionally, I may include links to relevant articles, tutorials, or papers that I find helpful during my journey.

## Contributions and Feedback
While this repository primarily serves as a personal coding challenge, I welcome contributions and feedback from the community. If you spot any errors in the code or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I appreciate any insights or guidance that can further enhance my learning experience.

## Conclusion
I am excited to embark on this 100-day journey of coding in machine learning. I believe that consistent practice and exploration of diverse machine learning topics will broaden my skill set and deepen my understanding of this fascinating field. By the end of this challenge, I hope to have a comprehensive portfolio of machine learning projects and a stronger foundation in the principles and applications of machine learning.

Let's dive in and make the most of these 100 days of machine learning code!

Happy coding
