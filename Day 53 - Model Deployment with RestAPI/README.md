## Day 53 - Model Deployment with RestAPI

- A REST API, represented in the code with Flask, is a way to allow communication between different software applications over HTTP, enabling data exchange and functionality access.

- Flask simplifies the process of creating REST APIs in Python by providing a lightweight and flexible framework for routing and handling HTTP requests.

- Your provided code combines Flask with the Hugging Face Transformers library, allowing you to create a REST API for text classification using pre-trained models like BERT.
