## Day 33 - Proximal Policy Optimization

- The code implements the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm using TensorFlow, a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm known for its stability and strong performance.

- It combines a policy network for action selection and a value network for estimating state values, allowing for more stable and efficient training.

- PPO's clipped surrogate objective and value function updates are used to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation, preventing overly large policy updates and improving learning stability.
