## Day 42 - Explainable AI

- The code demonstrates the use of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to explain the predictions of a Decision Tree classifier trained on the Iris dataset. It provides insights into the feature importance and individual prediction explanations.

- It uses the scikit-learn library for creating and training the Decision Tree classifier and SHAP for explaining the model's predictions, making it a comprehensive example of model interpretability.

- The code evaluates the model's performance by calculating the accuracy of predictions on a test set, and it also allows for the specific explanation of a prediction using SHAP's force plot.
