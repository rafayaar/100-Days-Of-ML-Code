## Day 26 - Image Segmentation 
- This code shows basic implementation of Object Detection on a OCT Image Dataset
- Unet architecture is used to implement this technique. Unet is basically a CNN, which is specifically developed for Biomedical Image segmentation
- A dataset contained images in the form of .mat files
- Same implementation as Conolutional Neural Networks
