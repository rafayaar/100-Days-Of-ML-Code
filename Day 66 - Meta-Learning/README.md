## Day 66 - Meta-Learning

- This code implements a basic meta-learning setup using model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML), where a model is trained to adapt quickly to new tasks with limited data by updating its parameters through both support and query sets.
- The inner_update function performs the inner loop optimization, adapting the model's parameters on the support set using gradient information. It creates a deep copy of the model to avoid in-place parameter modifications during the inner update
- The provided code serves as a minimal example of meta-learning in PyTorch, illustrating the core concepts of MAML. It uses a simple linear regression model and stochastic gradient descent for meta-training, making it suitable for educational purposes and as a starting point for more complex meta-learning scenarios
