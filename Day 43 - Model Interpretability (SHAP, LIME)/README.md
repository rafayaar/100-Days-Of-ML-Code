## Day 43 - Model Interpretability (SHAP, LIME)

- This code provides a comprehensive example of model interpretability by using both SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and Lime (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) techniques to explain the predictions of a Decision Tree classifier on the Iris dataset.

- It demonstrates the integration of two distinct interpretability libraries (SHAP and Lime) for explaining model predictions, allowing for a more thorough analysis of the model's behavior.

- The code calculates the model's accuracy on the test set to evaluate its performance, ensuring a well-rounded understanding of the model's predictive capabilities and interpretability.
