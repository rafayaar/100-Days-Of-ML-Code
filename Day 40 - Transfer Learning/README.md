## Day 40 - Transfer Learning

- The code demonstrates transfer learning using the VGG16 model, a popular pre-trained convolutional neural network. It loads the VGG16 model with pre-trained weights on the ImageNet dataset, excluding the top classification layer.

- The code sets the pre-trained VGG16 model's weights to be non-trainable by setting base_model.trainable to False. This ensures that the model's existing knowledge learned on ImageNet is retained and not modified during further training.

- The code preprocesses the input data for both the training and testing datasets using preprocess_input from the VGG16 module. Proper data preprocessing is essential to ensure that the input data is in a suitable format for the VGG16 model and helps improve the model's performance when fine-tuning or using it for transfer learning
