## Day 60 - Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic

- Anomaly detection in network traffic involves identifying unusual patterns or behaviors that deviate from established norms, helping to detect potential security threats or performance issues.

- Machine learning algorithms play a crucial role in anomaly detection by analyzing vast amounts of network data to distinguish normal behavior from abnormal patterns, enabling proactive threat mitigation.

- Continuous monitoring and real-time analysis are essential for effective anomaly detection in network traffic, allowing for rapid response to emerging threats and ensuring the integrity and security of the network.
