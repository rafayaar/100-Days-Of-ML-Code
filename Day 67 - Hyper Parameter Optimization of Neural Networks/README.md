## Day 67 - Hyper Parameter Optimization of Neural Networks

- This code efficiently utilizes the simplicity of scikit-learn's GridSearchCV to explore a predefined hyperparameter grid for a neural network, making it easy to perform exhaustive search without writing extensive loops.
- By incorporating a scikit-learn pipeline, the code seamlessly combines data preprocessing (scaling) with the neural network model (MLPClassifier), streamlining the workflow and enhancing code readability.
- The n_jobs=-1 parameter in GridSearchCV enables parallel processing, leveraging multiple CPU cores for faster hyperparameter tuning, a practical optimization for reducing computational time.
