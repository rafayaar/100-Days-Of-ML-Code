## Day 68 - Sequence-to-Sequence Models

- The code utilizes LSTM layers to create a sequence-to-sequence model, which is capable of handling variable-length input and output sequences, making it suitable for tasks like machine translation.

- In the inference phase, the decoder generates the output sequence token by token based on the input sequence, employing a loop that samples each token and updates the decoder's internal states until a stop token is encountered or the maximum sequence length is reached.

- The code demonstrates how to preprocess input sequences, train a seq2seq model, and perform inference, highlighting the end-to-end process of building and utilizing sequence-to-sequence architectures for tasks such as language translation.
