## Day 35 - Time Series Analysis

- The provided code implements matrix factorization using stochastic gradient descent to learn user and item matrices for predicting user-item interactions in a recommendation system.

- It uses random initialization of user and item matrices, which are updated iteratively to minimize the error between the predicted and actual user-item interactions.

- The code demonstrates a basic example and does not include data loading or evaluation metrics, which are essential components in real-world recommendation system development.
