## Day 37 - Long Short Term Memory (LSTMs)

- The code defines a sequential neural network model using Keras with TensorFlow backend for sentiment analysis on the IMDb movie reviews dataset. It utilizes an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layer for sequential data processing.

- The LSTM layer is preceded by an embedding layer, which converts input word indices into dense vector representations. SpatialDropout1D is applied to the embedding output to reduce overfitting by dropping randomly selected elements along the time dimension.

- The model is trained with binary cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer. After training, it is evaluated on the test dataset, and the test loss and accuracy are printed as one-liner insights into the model's performance.
