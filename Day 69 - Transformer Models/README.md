## Day 69 - Transformer Models

- The code demonstrates seamless integration with the Hugging Face Transformers library, allowing easy access to pre-trained transformer models, in this case, GPT-2, for natural language generation tasks.
- The generate_text function encapsulates the process of generating text using the specified transformer model and tokenizer. It provides flexibility by allowing customization of parameters like max_length and temperature for controlling the generated text's length and randomness.
- he code intelligently selects the device (cuda for GPU if available, otherwise cpu) to efficiently run the transformer model, considering hardware capabilities. This ensures optimal performance based on the available resources.
