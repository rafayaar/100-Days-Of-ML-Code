## Day 31 - Deep Q Netoworks
- eep Q-learning is a reinforcement learning technique that combines Q-learning with deep neural networks to approximate optimal action-value functions for complex decision-making tasks.

- It uses a deep neural network to estimate the Q-values of different actions in a given state, allowing it to handle high-dimensional state spaces, making it well-suited for tasks like video game playing and robotics.

- Deep Q-learning employs techniques like experience replay and target networks to stabilize training and improve convergence, making it a powerful tool for training agents to make sequential decisions in dynamic environments.
