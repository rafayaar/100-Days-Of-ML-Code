## Day 52 - Model Deployment with Flask

- This Flask implementation serves as an API endpoint for text classification using a pre-trained BERT model. It accepts text data via a POST request to the '/classify' endpoint, tokenizes the input, and then feeds it to the model for classification.

- It uses the 'transformers' library, which is a popular tool for working with pre-trained NLP models, including tokenization and inference. In this case, it employs the "bert-base-uncased" model for text classification.

- In the event of an error during text classification or any other exception, the server will respond with a JSON object containing an 'error' field to provide information about the encountered issue.
