## Day 54 - Model Deployment with TensorFlow Serving

- The code combines Hugging Face Transformers and TensorFlow Serving to deploy a BERT-based text classification model using Flask for REST API endpoints.

- It converts a pre-trained Hugging Face Transformers model to TensorFlow SavedModel format, which can be served by TensorFlow Serving for efficient inference.

- TensorFlow Serving is used to serve the SavedModel, allowing clients to send text data for classification requests via HTTP POST requests.

- The Flask application acts as an intermediary, forwarding incoming text data to the TensorFlow Serving server and returning the predicted class in the response.
