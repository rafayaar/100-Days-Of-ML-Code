## Day 70 - Attention Mechanisms

- The code generates synthetic sequences of text in two languages (input and target) and uses an attention-based seq2seq model with LSTM layers to perform machine translation between these languages.

- The model is trained with a sparse categorical crossentropy loss and Adam optimizer for 10 epochs, using randomly generated training data. The training data consists of input and target sequences that are tokenized and padded.

- The attention mechanism is employed to capture relevant information from the encoder's output when generating each word in the decoder, enhancing the model's ability to handle varying input lengths and improving translation performance.
