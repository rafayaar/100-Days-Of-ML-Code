## Day 63 - Customer Segmentation

- The code performs customer segmentation using K-means clustering on the Mall Customer Segmentation dataset and provides a 2D visualization of the clusters using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- The Elbow Method is employed to determine the optimal number of clusters (k=5) for customer segmentation, helping strike a balance between cluster granularity and simplicity.
- The code uses a real-world dataset (Mall Customer Segmentation) to demonstrate how clustering can be applied for practical insights into customer behavior based on their annual income and spending score.
