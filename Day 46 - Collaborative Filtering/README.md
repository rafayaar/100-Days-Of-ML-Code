## Day 46 - Collaborative Filtering

- The code implements item-based collaborative filtering using cosine similarity on a MovieLens dataset, allowing you to make movie recommendations based on user interactions.

- It uses a user-movie matrix to calculate item-item similarity and provides recommendations for a specific user by identifying movies with the highest similarity to their previous ratings.

- The code is a simplified example and serves as a starting point for building a recommendation system, with room for further refinement and optimization for real-world applications.
