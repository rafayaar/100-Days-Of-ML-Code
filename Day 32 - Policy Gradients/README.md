## Day 32 - Policy Gradients
- This code defines a reinforcement learning training loop using TensorFlow and Gym to train an agent to balance a pole on a cart in the 'CartPole-v1' environment.

- It uses a policy gradient method with a neural network (PolicyNetwork) to approximate the policy. The policy network takes the current state as input and outputs a probability distribution over possible actions.

- The training loop samples actions from the policy, collects episode data, calculates discounted rewards, and uses them to update the policy network's weights using a custom loss function that encourages actions that lead to higher rewards. Training is done using the Adam optimizer, and episode progress is printed every 10 episodes.
