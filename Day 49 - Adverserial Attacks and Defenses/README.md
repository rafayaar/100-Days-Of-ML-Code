## Day 49 - Adverserial Attacks and Defenses

- The code demonstrates a simple adversarial attack using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) to generate perturbed images that can deceive a deep learning model into making incorrect predictions.

- It leverages a pre-trained ResNet-50 model from PyTorch's model zoo and showcases the ease of implementing adversarial attacks by applying slight perturbations to input images.

- While this code serves as a basic introduction to adversarial attacks, real-world applications require more sophisticated techniques and robust defenses to mitigate the vulnerability of machine learning models to adversarial examples.
